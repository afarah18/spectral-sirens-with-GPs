	abstract = {We use 47 gravitational-wave sources from the Third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) to estimate the Hubble parameter \$H(z)\$, including its current value, the Hubble constant \$H\_0\$. Each gravitational-wave (GW) signal provides the luminosity distance to the source and we estimate the corresponding redshift using two methods: the redshifted masses and a galaxy catalog. Using the binary black hole (BBH) redshifted masses, we simultaneously infer the source mass distribution and \$H(z)\$. The source mass distribution displays a peak around \$34{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, followed by a drop-off. Assuming this mass scale does not evolve with redshift results in a \$H(z)\$ measurement, yielding \$H\_0=68{\textasciicircum}\{+12\}\_\{-7\} \{{\textbackslash}rm km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ (\$68{\textbackslash}\%\$ credible interval) when combined with the \$H\_0\$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. This represents an improvement of 17\% with respect to the \$H\_0\$ estimate from GWTC-1. The second method associates each GW event with its probable host galaxy in the catalog GLADE+, statistically marginalizing over the redshifts of each event's potential hosts. Assuming a fixed BBH population, we estimate a value of \$H\_0=68{\textasciicircum}\{+8\}\_\{-6\} \{{\textbackslash}rm km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ with the galaxy catalog method, an improvement of 42\% with respect to our GWTC-1 result and 20\% with respect to recent \$H\_0\$ studies using GWTC-2 events. However, we show that this result is strongly impacted by assumptions about the BBH source mass distribution; the only event which is not strongly impacted by such assumptions (and is thus informative about \$H\_0\$) is the well-localized event GW190814.},

	abstract = {We explore the use of the mass spectrum of neutron stars and black holes in gravitational-wave compact binary sources as a cosmological probe. These standard siren sources provide direct measurements of luminosity distance. In addition, features in the mass distribution, such as mass gaps or peaks, will redshift, and thus provide independent constraints on their redshift distribution. We argue that the entire mass spectrum should be utilized to provide cosmological constraints. For example, we find that the mass spectrum of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA events introduces at least five independent mass ``features'': the upper and lower edges of the pair instability supernova (PISN) gap, the upper and lower edges of the neutron star--black hole gap, and the minimum neutron star mass. We find that although the PISN gap dominates the cosmological inference with current detectors (2G), as shown in previous work, it is the lower mass gap that will provide the most powerful constraints in the era of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (3G). By using the full mass distribution, we demonstrate that degeneracies between mass evolution and cosmological evolution can be broken, unless an astrophysical conspiracy shifts all features of the full mass distribution simultaneously following the (non-trivial) Hubble diagram evolution. We find that this self-calibrating ``spectral siren'' method has the potential to provide precision constraints of both cosmology and the evolution of the mass distribution, with 2G achieving better than \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision on \$H(z)\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim1\$ within a year, and 3G reaching \${\textbackslash}lesssim1{\textbackslash}\%\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim2\$ within one month.},

	abstract = {Detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral phase of binary neutron star coalescence will allow us to measure the effects of the tidal coupling in such systems. Tidal effects provide additional contributions to the phase evolution of the gravitational wave signal that break a degeneracy between the system’s mass parameters and redshift and thereby allow the simultaneous measurement of both the effective distance and the redshift for individual sources. Using the population of O(103-107) detectable binary neutron star systems predicted for 3rd generation gravitational wave detectors, the luminosity distance-redshift relation can be probed independently of the cosmological distance ladder and independently of electromagnetic observations. We conclude that for a range of representative neutron star equations of state the redshift of such systems can be determined to an accuracy of 8\%-40\% for z{\textless}1 and 9\%-65\% for 1},

	abstract = {We explore the prospects for constraining cosmology using gravitational-wave (GW) observations of neutron-star binaries by the proposed Einstein Telescope (ET), exploiting the narrowness of the neutron-star mass function. This builds on our previous work in the context of advanced-era GW detectors. Double neutron-star (DNS) binaries are expected to be one of the first sources detected after “first-light” of Advanced LIGO. DNS systems are expected to be detected at a rate of a few tens per year in the advanced era, but the proposed ET could catalog tens, if not hundreds, of thousands per year. Combining the measured source redshift distributions with GW-network distance determinations will permit not only the precision measurement of background cosmological parameters, but will provide an insight into the astrophysical properties of these DNS systems. Of particular interest will be to probe the distribution of delay times between DNS-binary creation and subsequent merger, as well as the evolution of the star-formation rate density within ET’s detection horizon. Keeping H0, Ωm,0 and ΩΛ,0 fixed and investigating the precision with which the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters could be recovered, we found that with 105 detected DNS binaries, we could constrain these parameters to an accuracy similar to forecasted constraints from future CMB+BAO+SNIa measurements. Furthermore, modeling the merger delay-time distribution as a power-law (∝tα) and the star-formation rate density as a parametrized version of the Porciani and Madau SF2 model, we find that the associated astrophysical parameters are constrained to within ∼10\%. All parameter precisions scaled as 1/√N, where N is the number of cataloged detections. We also investigated how parameter precisions varied with the intrinsic underlying properties of the Universe and with the distance reach of the network (which is affected, for instance, by the low-frequency cutoff of the detector). We also consider various sources of distance-measurement errors in the third-generation era and how these can be folded into the analysis.},

Instead of prespecifying the formalisms of mass distribution, we introduce a more ﬂexible and nonparametric model with which the distribution can be mainly determined by the observed data. We ﬁrst test our method with simulated data and ﬁnd that it can well recover the injected distribution. Then, we apply this method to analyze the data of BBHs’ observations from LIGO-Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 2. By reconstructing the chirp mass distribution, we ﬁnd that there is a peak or a platform located at 20–30 Me rather than a single-power-law-like decrease from low mass to high mass. Moreover, one or two peaks in the chirp mass range of  {\textless} 20 M may be favored by the data. Assuming a mass-independent mass ratio distribution of p(q) ∝ q1.4, we further obtain a distribution of primary mass and ﬁnd that there is a feature located in the range of (30, 40) Me, which can be related to BROKEN POWER LAW and POWER LAW + PEAK distributions described in Collaboration et al. Besides, the merger rate of BBHs is estimated to be  = 26.29-+81.49.621 Gpc-3 yr-1, supposing that there is no redshift evolution.},

We describe a procedure for clustering in the multidimensional parameter space of observations that are subject to significant measurement errors. We apply this procedure to a mock data set of population-synthesis predictions for the masses of merging compact binaries convolved with realistic measurement uncertainties, and demonstrate that we can accurately distinguish subpopulations of binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and mixed neutron star–black hole binaries with tens of observations.},

We investigate the efficacy of our model on simulated data sets and demonstrate its capability to reconstruct correctly a variety of population models without the need of fine-tuning of the algorithm. We apply our method to the problem of inferring the black hole mass function given a set of gravitational wave observations from LIGO and Virgo, and find that the (H)DPGMM infers a binary black hole mass function that is consistent with previous estimates without the requirement of a theoretically motivated parametric model. Although the number of systems observed is still too small for a robust inference, (H)DPGMM confirms the presence of at least two distinct modes in the observed merging black hole mass function, hence suggesting in a model-independent fashion the presence of at least two classes of binary black hole systems.},

	abstract = {We investigate the constraint ability of the gravitational wave (GW) as the standard siren on the cosmological parameters by using the third-generation gravitational wave detector: the Einstein Telescope. The binary merger of a neutron with either a neutron or black hole is hypothesized to be the progenitor of a short and intense burst of γ rays; some fraction of those binary mergers could be detected both through electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Thus we can determine both the luminosity distance and redshift of the source separately. We simulate the luminosity distances and redshift measurements from 100 to 1000 GW events. We use two different algorithms to constrain the cosmological parameters. For the Hubble constant H0 and dark matter density parameter Ωm, we adopt the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We find that with about 500–600 GW events we can constrain the Hubble constant with an accuracy comparable to Planck temperature data and Planck lensing combined results, while for the dark matter density, GWs alone seem not able to provide the constraints as good as for the Hubble constant; the sensitivity of 1000 GW events is a little lower than that of Planck data. It should require more than 1000 events to match the Planck sensitivity. Yet, for analyzing the more complex dynamical property of dark energy, i.e., the equation of state w, we adopt a new powerful nonparametric method: the Gaussian process. We can reconstruct w directly from the observational luminosity distance at every redshift. In the low redshift region, we find that about 700 GW events can give the constraints of w(z) comparable to the constraints of a constant w by Planck data with type-Ia supernovae. Those results show that GWs as the standard sirens to probe the cosmological parameters can provide an independent and complementary alternative to current experiments.},

Depending on the mock data set, two statistical estimators are applied: one assumes that the redshift is known, while the other marginalizes over it assuming a specific redshift prior distribution. We demonstrate that (i) using mock catalogues collecting gravitational wave signals emitted by binary neutron stars systems to which a short gamma-ray burst has been associated, Einstein Telescope may achieve an accuracy on the cosmological parameters of \${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{H\_0\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.40\$ km s-1 Mpc-1, \${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}Omega \_\{k,0\}\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.09\$, and \${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}Omega \_\{{\textbackslash}Lambda ,0\}\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.07\$; while (ii) using mock catalogues collecting all gravitational wave signals emitted by binary neutron stars systems for which an electromagnetic counterpart has not been detected, Einstein Telescope may achieve an accuracy on the cosmological parameters of \${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{H\_0\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.04\$ km s-1 Mpc-1, \${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}Omega \_\{k,0\}\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.01\$, and \${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}Omega \_\{{\textbackslash}Lambda ,0\}\}{\textbackslash}approx 0.01\$, once the redshift probability distribution of GW events is known from from population synthesis simulations and/or the measure of the tidal deformability parameter.

Hundreds of planets have been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the first time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We confirm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius. We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

We look at several applications. First, for differentially private regression; second, to make predictions over other integrals; and third when the input regions are irregularly shaped collections of polytopes. In summary, our method provides an effective way of analysing binned data such that one can use more information from the histogram representation, and thus reconstruct a more useful and precise density for making predictions.},

These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

Our formulae are widely applicable over the range of the density parameter and the redshift with sufficiently small uncertainties. In particular, in the range of density parameter \$0.3 {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\} {\textbackslash}leq 1\$ and redshift \$0.03 {\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq 1000\$, the relative error for the luminosity distance by our formula is always smaller than that of the recent work by Wickramasinghe and Ukwatta (2010).

For example, there are kinematic gaps opened by resonances in dynamical systems, or exoplanets of a certain radius that are empirically rare. A gap in a data set is a kind of anomaly, but in an unusual sense: Instead of being a single outlier data point, situated far from other data points, it is a region of the space, or a set of points, that is anomalous compared to its surroundings. Gaps are both interesting and hard to find and characterize, especially when they have non-trivial shapes. We present in this paper a statistic that can be used to estimate the (local) "gappiness" of a point in the data space. It uses the gradient and Hessian of the density estimate (and thus requires a twice-differentiable density estimator). This statistic can be computed at (almost) any point in the space and does not rely on optimization; it allows to highlight under-dense regions of any dimensionality and shape in a general and efficient way. We illustrate our method on the velocity distribution of nearby stars in the Milky Way disk plane, which exhibits gaps that could originate from different processes. Identifying and characterizing those gaps could help determine their origins. We provide in an Appendix implementation notes and additional considerations for finding under-densities in data, using critical points and the properties of the Hessian of the density.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large datasets. Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this purpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small datasets. In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process modeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable Gaussian Process methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

This involves evaluating a multi-dimensional posterior probability function with stochastic sampling. The marginal probability density distributions from which the samples are drawn are usually interpolated with kernel density estimators. Since most post-processing analysis within the field is based on these parameter estimation products, interpolation accuracy of the marginals is essential. In this work, we propose a new method combining histograms and Gaussian Processes as an alternative technique to fit arbitrary combinations of samples from the source parameters. This method comes with several advantages such as flexible interpolation of non-Gaussian correlations, Bayesian estimate of uncertainty, and efficient re-sampling with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.},

	abstract = {Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) can constrain the cosmic expansion of the universe. In the absence of an associated electromagnetic counterpart, the spectral sirens method exploits the relation between the detector frame and the source frame masses to jointly infer the parameters of the mass distribution of black holes (BH) and the cosmic expansion parameter \$H\_0\$. This technique relies on the choice of the parametrization for the source mass population of BHs observed in binary black holes merger (BBHs). Using astrophysically motivated BBH populations, we study the possible systematic effects affecting the inferred value for \$H\_0\$ when using heuristic mass models like a broken power law, a power law plus peak and a multi-peak distributions. We find that with 2000 detected GW mergers, the resulting \$H\_0\$ obtained with a spectral sirens analysis can be biased up to \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$. The main sources of this bias come from the failure of the heuristic mass models used so far to account for a possible redshift evolution of the mass distribution and from their inability to model unexpected mass features. We conclude that future dark siren GW cosmology analyses should make use of source mass models able to account for redshift evolution and capable to adjust to unforeseen mass features.},

	abstract = {The continued operation of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors is enabling the first detailed measurements of the mass, spin, and redshift distributions of the merging binary black hole population. Our present knowledge of these distributions, however, is based largely on strongly parameteric models; such models typically assume the distributions of binary parameters to be superpositions of power laws, peaks, dips, and breaks, and then measure the parameters governing these "building block" features. Although this approach has yielded great progress in initial characterization of the compact binary population, the strong assumptions entailed leave it often unclear which physical conclusions are driven by observation and which by the specific choice of model. In this paper, we instead model the merger rate of binary black holes as an unknown autoregressive process over the space of binary parameters, allowing us to measure the distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, component spins, and effective spins with near-complete agnosticism. We find the primary mass spectrum of binary black holes to be doubly-peaked, with a fairly flat continuum that steepens at high masses. We identify signs of unexpected structure in the redshift distribution of binary black holes: a uniform-in-comoving volume merger rate at low redshift followed by a rise in the merger rate beyond redshift \$z{\textbackslash}approx 0.5\$. Finally, we find that the distribution of black hole spin magnitudes is unimodal and concentrated at small but non-zero values, and that spin orientations span a wide range of spin-orbit misalignment angles but are also unlikely to be truly isotropic.},

Constructed from basis splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting nonparametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment, and redshift distributions. With GWTC-3, we report the same features previously recovered with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of {\textasciitilde}10M ⊙ and {\textasciitilde}35M ⊙. Our model reports a suppressed merger rate at low primary masses and a mass-ratio distribution consistent with a power law. We infer a distribution for primary spin misalignments that peaks away from alignment, supporting conclusions of recent work. We find broad agreement with the previous inferences of the spin magnitude distribution: the majority of BBH spins are small (a {\textless} 0.5), the distribution peaks at a {\textasciitilde} 0.2, and there is mild support for a nonspinning subpopulation, which may be resolved with larger catalogs. With a modulated power law describing the BBH merger rate's evolution in redshift, we see hints of the rate evolution either flattening or decreasing at z {\textasciitilde} 0.2-0.5, but the full distribution remains entirely consistent with a monotonically increasing power law. We conclude with a discussion of the astrophysical context of our new findings and how nonparametric methods in gravitational-wave population inference are uniquely poised to complement to the parametric approach as we enter the data-rich era of gravitational-wave astronomy.},

Using realistic detector noise estimates, we characterize the rate of detections as a function of a threshold signal-to-noise ratio \${\textbackslash}rho\_0\$, the Hubble constant \$H\_0\$, and the binary ``chirp'' mass. For \${\textbackslash}rho\_0 = 8\$, \$H\_0 = 100\$ km/s/Mpc, and \$1.4 {\textbackslash}msun\$ neutron star binaries, the sample has a median redshift of \$0.22\$.

Many different possible realizations of the EOS are generated with a Gaussian process conditioned on a set of nuclear-theoretic models. These synthetic EOSs are causal and thermodynamically stable by construction, span a broad region of the pressure-density plane, and can be selected to satisfy astrophysical constraints on the NS mass. Associating every synthetic EOS with a pair of component masses M1 ,2 and calculating the corresponding tidal deformabilities Λ1 ,2, we perform Monte Carlo integration over the GW likelihood for M1 ,2 and Λ1 ,2 to directly infer a posterior process for the NS EOS. We first demonstrate that the method can accurately recover the properties of an injected GW signal, and subsequently use it to analyze data from GW170817, finding a canonical deformability of Λ1.4=16 0-113+448 and p (2 ρnuc)=1.3 5-1.2+1.8×1034 dyn /cm2 for the pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density at 90\% confidence, in agreement with previous studies, when assuming a loose EOS prior. With a prior more tightly constrained to resemble the theoretical EOS models, we recover Λ1.4=55 6-172+163 and p (2 ρnuc)=4.7 3-2.5+1.4×1034 dyn /cm2 . We further infer the maximum NS mass supported by the EOS to be Mmax=2.0 9-0.16+0.37 (2.0 4-0.002+0.22) M⊙ with the loose (tight) prior. The Bayes factor between the two priors is BIA≃1.12 , suggesting that neither is strongly preferred by the data and that constraints on the EOS from GW170817 alone may be sensitive to the choice of prior.},

Waveforms from numerical relativity (NR), while highly accurate, are too computationally expensive to produce to be directly used with Bayesian parameter estimation tools like Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo and nested sampling. We propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR) method to generate reduced-order-model waveforms based only on existing accurate (e.g. NR) simulations. Using a training set of simulated waveforms, our GPR approach produces interpolated waveforms along with uncertainties across the parameter space. As a proof of concept, we use a training set of IMRPhenomD waveforms to build a GPR model in the 2-d parameter space of mass ratio q and equal-and-aligned spin χ1=χ2. Using a regular, equally-spaced grid of 120 IMRPhenomD training waveforms in q ∈[1 ,3 ] and χ1∈[-0.5 ,0.5 ], the GPR mean approximates IMRPhenomD in this space to mismatches below 4.3 ×10-5. Our approach could in principle use training waveforms directly from numerical relativity. Beyond interpolation of waveforms, we also present a greedy algorithm that utilizes the errors provided by our GPR model to optimize the placement of future simulations. In a fiducial test case we find that using the greedy algorithm to iteratively add simulations achieves GPR errors that are ∼1 order of magnitude lower than the errors from using Latin-hypercube or square training grids.},

The inspiral evolution is described using a consistent combination of post-Newtonian theory, self-force and black hole perturbation theory. Assuming eccentric binaries that circularize prior to coalescence, we smoothly match the eccentric inspiral with a stand-alone, quasicircular merger, which is constructed using machine learning algorithms that are trained with quasicircular numerical relativity waveforms. We show that ENIGMA reproduces with excellent accuracy the dynamics of quasicircular compact binaries. We validate ENIGMA using a set of Einstein Toolkit eccentric numerical relativity waveforms, which describe eccentric binary black hole mergers with mass-ratios between 1 ≤q ≤5.5 , and eccentricities e0≲0.2 ten orbits before merger. We use this model to explore in detail the physics that can be extracted with moderately eccentric, nonspinning binary black hole mergers. In particular, we use ENIGMA to show that the gravitational wave transients GW150914, GW151226, GW170104, GW170814 and GW170608 can be effectively recovered with spinning, quasicircular templates if the eccentricity of these events at a gravitational wave frequency of 10 Hz satisfies e0≤\{0.175 ,0.125 ,0.175 ,0.175 ,0.125 \}, respectively. We show that if these systems have eccentricities e0∼0.1 at a gravitational wave frequency of 10 Hz, they can be misclassified as quasicircular binaries due to parameter space degeneracies between eccentricity and spin corrections. Using our catalog of eccentric numerical relativity simulations, we discuss the importance of including higher-order waveform multipoles in gravitational wave searches of eccentric binary black hole mergers.},

	abstract = {The observation of gravitational waves from multiple compact binary coalescences by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector networks has enabled us to infer the underlying distribution of compact binaries across a wide range of masses, spins, and redshifts. In light of the new features found in the mass spectrum of binary black holes and the uncertainty regarding binary formation models, non-parametric population inference has become increasingly popular. In this work, we develop a data-driven clustering framework that can identify features in the component mass distribution of compact binaries simultaneously with those in the corresponding redshift distribution, from gravitational wave data in the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, while making very few assumptions on the functional form of these distributions. Our generalized model is capable of inferring correlations among various population properties such as the redshift evolution of the shape of the mass distribution itself, in contrast to most existing non-parametric inference schemes. We test our model on simulated data and demonstrate the accuracy with which it can re-construct the underlying distributions of component masses and redshifts. We also re-analyze public LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from events in GWTC-3 using our model and compare our results with those from some alternative parametric and non-parametric population inference approaches. Finally, we investigate the potential presence of correlations between mass and redshift in the population of binary black holes in GWTC-3 (those observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network in their first 3 observing runs), without making any assumptions about the specific nature of these correlations.},

	abstract = {The recent advanced LIGO detections of gravitational waves from merging binary black holes enhance the prospect of exploring binary evolution via gravitational-wave observations of a population of compact-object binaries. In the face of uncertainty about binary formation models, model-independent inference provides an appealing alternative to comparisons between observed and modelled populations. We describe a procedure for clustering in the multidimensional parameter space of observations that are subject to significant measurement errors. We apply this procedure to a mock data set of population-synthesis predictions for the masses of merging compact binaries convolved with realistic measurement uncertainties, and demonstrate that we can accurately distinguish subpopulations of binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and mixed neutron star–black hole binaries with tens of observations.},

	abstract = {We report on the population properties of compact binary mergers inferred from gravitational-wave observations of these systems during the first three LIGO-Virgo observing runs. The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) contains signals consistent with three classes of binary mergers: binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole mergers. We infer the binary neutron star merger rate to be between 10 and 1700 Gpc−3 yr−1 and the neutron star-black hole merger rate to be between 7.8 and 140 Gpc−3 yr−1 , assuming a constant rate density in the comoving frame and taking the union of 90\% credible intervals for methods used in this work. We infer the binary black hole merger rate, allowing for evolution with redshift, to be between 17.9 and 44 Gpc-3 yr-1 at a fiducial redshift (z =0.2 ). The rate of binary black hole mergers is observed to increase with redshift at a rate proportional to (1 +z )κ with κ =2. 9-1.8+1.7 for z ≲1 . Using both binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries, we obtain a broad, relatively flat neutron star mass distribution extending from 1.2-0.2+0.1 to 2.0-0.3+0.3M⊙. We confidently determine that the merger rate as a function of mass sharply declines after the expected maximum neutron star mass, but cannot yet confirm or rule out the existence of a lower mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. We also find the binary black hole mass distribution has localized over- and underdensities relative to a power-law distribution, with peaks emerging at chirp masses of 8.3-0.5+0.3 and 27.9-1.8+1.9M⊙. While we continue to find that the mass distribution of a binary's more massive component strongly decreases as a function of primary mass, we observe no evidence of a strongly suppressed merger rate above approximately 60 M⊙, which would indicate the presence of a upper mass gap. Observed black hole spins are small, with half of spin magnitudes below χi≈0.25 . While the majority of spins are preferentially aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we infer evidence of antialigned spins among the binary population. We observe an increase in spin magnitude for systems with more unequal-mass ratio. We also observe evidence of misalignment of spins relative to the orbital angular momentum.},
