	title = {Embarrassingly {Parallel} {Inference} for {Gaussian} {Processes}},
	abstract = {Training Gaussian process-based models typically involves an O(N 3) computational bottleneck due to inverting the covariance matrix. Popular methods for overcoming this matrix inversion problem cannot adequately model all types of latent functions, and are often not parallelizable. However, judicious choice of model structure can ameliorate this problem. A mixture-of-experts model that uses a mixture of K Gaussian processes oﬀers modeling ﬂexibility and opportunities for scalable inference. Our embarrassingly parallel algorithm combines low-dimensional matrix inversions with importance sampling to yield a ﬂexible, scalable mixture-of-experts model that oﬀers comparable performance to Gaussian process regression at a much lower computational cost.},

The nearly monochromatic gravitational waves emitted by the decaying orbit of an ultra–compact, two–neutron–star binary system just before the stars coalesce are very likely to be detected by the kilometre–sized interferometric gravitational wave antennas now being designed1–4. The signal is easily identified and contains enough information to determine the absolute distance to the binary, independently of any assumptions about the masses of the stars. Ten events out to 100 Mpc may suffice to measure the Hubble constant to 3\% accuracy.},

We constrain properties of the BBH mass spectrum using models with a range of parameterizations of the BBH mass and spin distributions. We find that the mass distribution of the more massive BH in such binaries is well approximated by models with no more than 1\% of BHs more massive than 45 and a power-law index of α = (90\% credibility). We also show that BBHs are unlikely to be composed of BHs with large spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Modeling the evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift, we show that it is flat or increasing with redshift with 93\% probability. Marginalizing over uncertainties in the BBH population, we find robust estimates of the BBH merger rate density of R = Gpc−3 yr−1 (90\% credibility). As the BBH catalog grows in future observing runs, we expect that uncertainties in the population model parameters will shrink, potentially providing insights into the formation of BHs via supernovae, binary interactions of massive stars, stellar cluster dynamics, and the formation history of BHs across cosmic time.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian inference can simultaneously account for both measurement uncertainty and selection effects within astronomical catalogs. In particular, the imposed hierarchy encodes beliefs about the interdependence of the physical processes that generate the observed data. We show that several proposed approximations within the literature actually correspond to inferences that are incompatible with any physical detection process. This generically leads to biases and is associated with the assumption that detectability is independent of the observed data given the true source parameters. We show several examples of how this error can affect astrophysical inferences based on catalogs of coalescing binaries observed through gravitational waves, including misestimating the redshift evolution of the merger rate as well as incorrectly inferring that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity when it is not. In general, one cannot directly fit for the "detected distribution" and "divide out" the selection effects in post-processing. Similarly, when comparing theoretical predictions to observations, it is better to simulate detected data (including both measurement noise and selection effects) rather than comparing estimates of the detected distributions of event parameters (which include only selection effects). While the biases introduced by model misspecification from incorrect assumptions may be smaller than statistical uncertainty for moderate catalog sizes (O(100) events), they will nevertheless pose a significant barrier to precision measurements of astrophysical populations.},

Endorsing our previous report and a recent corroborating report from LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations, we observe the chirp mass distribution has multiple peaks and a lack of mergers with chirp masses 10-12 M ⊙. In addition, we observe that aligned spins show mass dependence with heavier binaries exhibiting larger spins, the mass ratio shows a dependence on the chirp mass but not on the aligned spin, and the redshift evolution of the merger rate for the peaks in the mass distribution is disparate. These features possibly reflect the astrophysics associated with the BBH formation channels. However, additional observations are needed to improve our limited confidence in them.},

We apply this model to the 46 BBHs included in the second gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-2). The spline perturbation model recovers a consistent primary mass distribution with previous results, corroborating the existence of a peak at 35 M ⊙ ({\textgreater}97\% credibility) found with the POWERLAW+PEAK model. The peak could be the result of pulsational pair-instability supernovae. The spline perturbation model finds potential signs of additional features in the primary mass distribution at lower masses similar to those previously reported by Tiwari and Fairhurst. However, with fluctuations due to small-number statistics, the simpler POWERLAW+PEAK and BROKENPOWERLAW models are both still perfectly consistent with observations. Our semiparametric approach serves as a way to bridge the gap between parametric and nonparametric models to more accurately measure the BBH mass distribution. With larger catalogs we will be able to use this model to resolve possible additional features that could be used to perform cosmological measurements and will build on our understanding of BBH formation, stellar evolution, and nuclear astrophysics.},

By coupling the growing sample of BBH systems with population synthesis models, we can begin to constrain the parameters of such models and glean unprecedented knowledge about the inherent physical processes that underpin binary stellar evolution. In this study, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian model to mass measurements from a synthetic GW sample to constrain the physical prescriptions in population models and the relative fraction of systems generated from various channels. We employ population models of two canonical formation scenarios in our analysis—isolated binary evolution involving a common-envelope phase and dynamical formation within globular clusters—with model variations for different black hole natal kick prescriptions. We show that solely with chirp mass measurements, it is possible to constrain natal kick prescriptions and the relative fraction of systems originating from each formation channel with \{ O \}(100) of confident detections. This framework can be extended to include additional formation scenarios, model parameters, and measured properties of the compact binary.},

We analyze this catalog using a suite of five state-of-the-art binary black hole population models covering a range of isolated and dynamical formation channels and infer branching fractions between channels as well as constraints on uncertain physical processes that impact the observational properties of mergers. Given our set of formation models, we find significant differences between the branching fractions of the underlying and detectable populations, and the diversity of detections suggests that multiple formation channels are at play. A mixture of channels is strongly preferred over any single channel dominating the detected population: an individual channel does not contribute to more than ≃70\% of the observational sample of binary black holes. We calculate the preference between the natal spin assumptions and common-envelope efficiencies in our models, favoring natal spins of isolated black holes of ≲0.1 and marginally preferring common-envelope efficiencies of ≳2.0 while strongly disfavoring highly inefficient common envelopes. We show that it is essential to consider multiple channels when interpreting GW catalogs, as inference on branching fractions and physical prescriptions becomes biased when contributing formation scenarios are not considered or incorrect physical prescriptions are assumed. Although our quantitative results can be affected by uncertain assumptions in model predictions, our methodology is capable of including models with updated theoretical considerations and additional formation channels.},

It has been established that the majority of massive stars reside in close binaries and will interact with their companion stars during their lifetime. Such interactions drastically alter their life cycles and complicate our understanding of their evolution, but are also responsible for the production of interesting and exotic interaction products. - Extensive observation campaigns with well-understood detection sensitivities have allowed to convert the observed properties into intrinsic characteristics, facilitating a direct comparison to theory. - Studies of large samples of massive stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds have unveiled new types of interaction products, providing critical constraints on the mass transfer phase and the formation of compact objects. - The direct detection of gravitational waves has revolutionized the study of stellar mass compact objects, providing a new window to study massive star evolution. Their formation processes are, however, still unclear. The known sample of compact object mergers will grow by orders of magnitude in the coming decade, turning into the best understood astrophysical population.},

	abstract = {The LIGO Scientific, Virgo and KAGRA Collaborations recently released the third gravitational wave transient catalog or GWTC-3, significantly expanding the number of gravitational wave signals. To address the—still uncertain—formation channels of the source compact binaries, their population properties must be characterized. The computational cost of the Bayesian hierarchical methods employed thus far scales with the size of the event catalogs, and such methods have until recently assumed fixed functional forms for the source distribution. Here we propose a fast and flexible method to reconstruct the population of LIGO-Virgo merging black hole (BH) binaries without such assumptions. For sufficiently high event statistics and sufficiently low individual event measurement error (relative to the scale of population features) a kernel density estimator (KDE) reconstruction of the event distribution will be accurate. We improve the accuracy and flexibility of KDE for finite event statistics using an adaptive bandwidth KDE (awKDE). We apply awKDE to publicly released parameter estimates for 44 significant (69) BH binary mergers in GWTC-2 (GWTC-3), in combination with a fast polynomial fit of search sensitivity, to obtain a nonparametric estimate of the mass distribution, and compare to Bayesian hierarchical methods. We also demonstrate a robust peak detection algorithm based on awKDE and use it to calculate the significance of the apparent peak in the BH mass distribution around 35 M⊙ . We find such a peak is very unlikely to have occurred if the true distribution is a featureless power-law (significance of 3.6 σ for confident GWTC-2 BBH events, 3.0 σ for confident GWTC-3 BBH events).},

	abstract = {The population analysis of compact binaries involves the reconstruction of some of the gravitational wave (GW) signal parameters, such as, the mass and the spin distribution, that gave rise to the observed data. This article introduces VAMANA, which reconstructs the binary black hole population using a mixture model and facilitates excellent density measurement as informed by the data. VAMANA uses a mixture of weighted Gaussians to reconstruct the chirp mass distribution. We expect Gaussian mixtures to provide flexibility in modeling complex distributions and enable us in capturing details in the astrophysical chirp mass distribution. Each of the Gaussian in the mixture is combined with another Gaussian and a power-law to simultaneously model the spin component aligned with the orbital angular momentum and the mass ratio distribution, thus also wing us to capture their variation with the chirp mass. Additionally, we can also introduce broadband smoothing by restricting the Gaussian mixture to lie within a threshold distance of a predefined reference chirp mass distribution. Using simulated data we show the robustness of our method in reconstructing complex populations for a large number of observations. We also apply our method to the publicly available catalog of GW observations made during LIGO’s and Virgo’s first and second observation runs and present the reconstructed mass, spin distribution, and the estimated merger rate of binary black holes.},

	abstract = {Gravitational wave standard sirens typically require electromagnetic (EM) data to obtain redshift information to constrain cosmology. Difficult to find EM counterparts for bright sirens and galaxy survey systematics for dark sirens make cosmological constraints with spectral sirens, a gravitational wave data-only approach, extremely appealing. In this work, we use the GWTC-3 BBH detections as spectral sirens to constrain the BBH population and the underlying cosmological expansion with a flexible model for the black hole mass spectrum. We use a binned Gaussian process to model the BBH mass distribution in the source frame without any astrophysical assumptions on the shape and or inclusion (or lack of) features that drive the cosmological constraints as the redshifted detector frame masses become consistent with the underlying astrophysical mass distribution features. For GWTC-3 we find a measurement on the Hubble constant of \$H\_0=73.0{\textasciicircum}\{+13.3\}\_\{-7.7\} {\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm\{km {\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\}\$ at \$68{\textbackslash}\%\$ C.L. when combined with that obtained from the bright standard siren analysis with GW170817 and its associated host galaxy NGC 4993. We find an improved estimate for the Hubble constant of around a factor of 1.4 times better than the GW170817 measurement alone. We validate our nonparametric spectral siren approach with simulations and benchmark its scalability and constraining performance when compared with parametric methods.},

	abstract = {Gravitational-wave detectors are starting to reveal the redshift evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) merger rate, R BBH(z). We make predictions for R BBH(z) as a function of black hole mass for systems originating from isolated binaries. To this end, we investigate correlations between the delay time and black hole mass by means of the suite of binary population synthesis simulations, COMPAS. We distinguish two channels: the common envelope (CE), and the stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) channel, characterized by whether the system has experienced a common envelope or not. We find that the CE channel preferentially produces BHs with masses below about 30 M ⊙ and short delay times (t delay ≲ 1 Gyr), while the stable RLOF channel primarily forms systems with BH masses above 30 M ⊙ and long delay times (t delay ≳ 1 Gyr). We provide a new fit for the metallicity-dependent specific star formation rate density based on the Illustris TNG simulations, and use this to convert the delay time distributions into a prediction of R BBH(z). This leads to a distinct redshift evolution of R BBH(z) for high and low primary BH masses. We furthermore find that, at high redshift, R BBH(z) is dominated by the CE channel, while at low redshift, it contains a large contribution ({\textasciitilde}40\%) from the stable RLOF channel. Our results predict that, for increasing redshifts, BBHs with component masses above 30 M ⊙ will become increasingly scarce relative to less massive BBH systems. Evidence of this distinct evolution of R BBH(z) for different BH masses can be tested with future detectors.},

	abstract = {We study the evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) mass distribution across cosmic time. The second gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-2) from LIGO/Virgo contains BBH events out to redshifts \$z {\textbackslash}sim 1\$, with component masses in the range \${\textbackslash}sim5\$--\$80{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. In this catalog, the biggest black holes, with \$m\_1 {\textbackslash}gtrsim 45{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, are only found at the highest redshifts, \$z {\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.4\$. We ask whether the absence of high-mass BBH observations at low redshift indicates that the astrophysical BBH mass distribution evolves: the biggest BBHs only merge at high redshift, and cease merging at low redshift. Alternatively, this feature might be explained by gravitational-wave selection effects. Modeling the BBH primary mass spectrum as a power law with a sharp maximum mass cutoff (Truncated model), we find that the cutoff increases with redshift (\${\textgreater} 99.9{\textbackslash}\%\$ credibility). An abrupt cutoff in the mass spectrum is expected from (pulsational) pair instability supernova simulations; however, GWTC-2 is only consistent with a Truncated mass model if the location of the cutoff increases from \$45{\textasciicircum}\{+13\}\_\{-5\}{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at \$z {\textless} 0.4\$ to \$80{\textasciicircum}\{+16\}\_\{-13\}{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at \$z {\textgreater} 0.4\$. Alternatively, if the primary mass spectrum has a break in the power law (Broken power law) at \$\{38{\textasciicircum}\{+15\}\_\{-8\}{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, rather than a sharp cutoff, the data are consistent with a non-evolving mass distribution. In this case, the overall rate of mergers, at all masses, increases with increasing redshift. Future observations will confidently distinguish between a sharp maximum mass cutoff that evolves with redshift and a non-evolving mass distribution with a gradual taper, such as a Broken power law. After \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ BBH merger observations, a continued absence of high-mass, low-redshift events would provide a clear signature that the mass distribution evolves with redshift.},

	abstract = {We perform a Bayesian analysis of the mass distribution of stellar-mass black holes using the observed masses of 15 low-mass X-ray binary systems undergoing Roche lobe overflow and 5 high-mass, wind-fed X-ray binary systems. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo calculations, we model the mass distribution both parametrically—as a power law, exponential, Gaussian, combination of two Gaussians, or log-normal distribution—and non-parametrically—as histograms with varying numbers of bins. We provide confidence bounds on the shape of the mass distribution in the context of each model and compare the models with each other by calculating their relative Bayesian evidence as supported by the measurements, taking into account the number of degrees of freedom of each model. The mass distribution of the low-mass systems is best fit by a power law, while the distribution of the combined sample is best fit by the exponential model. This difference indicates that the low-mass subsample is not consistent with being drawn from the distribution of the combined population. We examine the existence of a “gap” between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes by considering the value, M1\%, of the 1\% quantile from each black hole mass distribution as the lower bound of black hole masses. Our analysis generates posterior distributions for M1\%; the best model (the power law) fitted to the low-mass systems has a distribution of lower bounds with M1\%{\textgreater}4.3 M☉ with 90\% confidence, while the best model (the exponential) fitted to all 20 systems has M1\%{\textgreater}4.5 M☉ with 90\% confidence. We conclude that our sample of black hole masses provides strong evidence of a gap between the maximum neutron star mass and the lower bound on black hole masses. Our results on the low-mass sample are in qualitative agreement with those of Ozel et al., although our broad model selection analysis more reliably reveals the best-fit quantitative description of the underlying mass distribution. The results on the combined sample of low- and high-mass systems are in qualitative agreement with Fryer \& Kalogera, although the presence of a mass gap remains theoretically unexplained.},

We find that the observations are best described by a narrow mass distribution at 7.8 ± 1.2 M☉. We identify a selection effect related to the choice of targets for optical follow-ups that results in a flux-limited sample. We demonstrate, however, that this selection effect does not introduce a bias in the observed distribution and cannot explain the absence of black holes in the 2–5 M☉ mass range. On the high-mass end, we argue that the rapid decline in the inferred distribution may be the result of the particular evolutionary channel followed by low-mass X-ray binaries. This is consistent with the presence of high-mass black holes in the persistent, high-mass X-ray binary sources. If the paucity of low-mass black holes is caused by a sudden decrease of the supernova explosion energy with increasing progenitor mass, this would have observable implications for ongoing transient surveys that target core-collapse supernovae. Our results also have significant implications for the calculation of event rates from the coalescence of black hole binaries for gravitational wave detectors.},

We find overwhelming evidence for a bimodal distribution, in agreement with previous literature, and report for the first time positive evidence for a sharp cut-off at a maximum neutron star mass. We measure the maximum mass to be 2.0 M⊙ \&lt; mmax \&lt; 2.2 M⊙ (68 per cent), 2.0 M⊙ \&lt; mmax \&lt; 2.6 M⊙ (90 per cent), and evidence for a cut-off is robust against the choice of model for the mass distribution and to removing the most extreme (highest mass) neutron stars from the data set. If this sharp cut-off is interpreted as the maximum stable neutron star mass allowed by the equation of state of dense matter, our measurement puts constraints on the equation of state. For a set of realistic equations of state that support \&gt;2 M⊙ neutron stars, our inference of mmax is able to distinguish between models at odds ratios of up to 12:1, whilst under a flexible piecewise polytropic equation-of-state model our maximum mass measurement improves constraints on the pressure at 3–7× the nuclear saturation density by \$\{{\textbackslash}sim \} 30{\textbackslash}text\{--\}50{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$ compared to simply requiring mmax \&gt; 2 M⊙.

We use the results of recent two-dimensional simulations of stellar core collapse to obtain the relation between remnant and progenitor masses and fold it with an initial mass function for the progenitors. Thus, we are able to derive the binary black hole mass distribution. We examine how the calculated black hole mass distributions are modified by (1) strong-wind mass loss at different evolutionary stages of the progenitors and (2) the presence of close binary companions to the black hole progenitors. The compact-remnant distribution is dominated by neutron stars in the mass range 1.2-1.6 Msolar and falls off exponentially at higher remnant masses. Our results are most sensitive to mass loss from stellar winds (particularly from Wolf-Rayet stars), and the effects of winds are even more important in close binaries. Wind mass loss leads to flatter black hole mass distributions and limits the maximum possible black hole mass ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}10-15 Msolar). We also study the effects of the uncertainties in the explosion and unbinding energies for different progenitors. The distributions are continuous and extend over a broad range. We find no evidence for a gap at low values (3-5 Msolar) or for a peak at higher values ({\textasciitilde}7 Msolar) of black hole masses, but we argue that our black hole mass distribution for binaries is consistent with the current sample of measured black hole masses in X-ray transients. We discuss possible biases against the detection or formation of X-ray transients with low-mass black holes. We also comment on the possibility of black hole kicks and their effect on binaries.},

What are the properties of these populations? As the detection of gravitational waves is becoming routine and the size of the event catalog increases, finer and finer details of the astrophysical distribution of compact binaries are now within our grasp. This Chapter presents a pedagogical introduction to the main statistical tool required for these analyses: hierarchical Bayesian inference in the presence of selection effects. All key equations are obtained from first principles, followed by two examples of increasing complexity. Although many remarks made in this Chapter refer to gravitational-wave astronomy, the write-up is generic enough to be useful to researchers and graduate students from other fields.},

	abstract = {The binary neutron star (BNS) mass distribution measured with gravitational-wave observations has the potential to reveal information about the dense matter equation of state, supernova physics, the expansion rate of the universe, and tests of General Relativity. As most current gravitational-wave analyses measuring the BNS mass distribution do not simultaneously fit the spin distribution, the implied population-level spin distribution is the same as the spin prior applied when analyzing individual sources. In this work, we demonstrate that introducing a mismatch between the implied and true BNS spin distributions can lead to biases in the inferred mass distribution. This is due to the strong correlations between the measurements of the mass ratio and spin components aligned with the orbital angular momentum for individual sources. We find that applying a low-spin prior which excludes the true spin magnitudes of some sources in the population leads to significantly overestimating the maximum neutron star mass and underestimating the minimum neutron star mass at the population level with as few as six BNS detections. The safest choice of spin prior that does not lead to biases in the inferred mass distribution is one which allows for high spin magnitudes and tilts misaligned with the orbital angular momentum.},

	abstract = {We present icarogw 2.0, a pure CPU/GPU python code developed to infer astrophysical and cosmological population properties of noisy, heterogeneous, and incomplete observations. icarogw 2.0 is mainly developed for compact binary coalescence (CBC) population inference with gravitational wave (GW) observations. The code contains several models for masses, spins, and redshift of CBC distributions, and is able to infer population distributions as well as the cosmological parameters and possible general relativity deviations at cosmological scales. We present the theoretical and computational foundations of icarogw 2.0, and we describe how the code can be employed for population and cosmological inference using (i) only GWs, (ii) GWs and galaxy surveys and (iii) GWs with electromagnetic counterparts. We discuss the code performance on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), finding a gain in computation time of about two orders of magnitudes when more than 100 GW events are involved for the analysis. We validate the code by re-analyzing GW population and cosmological studies, finding very good agreement with previous publications.},

	abstract = {Six gravitational wave detections have been reported so far, providing crucial insights on the merger rate of double compact objects. We investigate the cosmic merger rate of double neutron stars (DNSs), neutron star black hole binaries (NSBHs), and black hole binaries (BHBs) by means of population-synthesis simulations coupled with the Illustris cosmological simulation. We have performed six different simulations, considering different assumptions for the efficiency of common envelope (CE) ejection and exploring two distributions for the supernova (SN) kicks. The current BHB merger rate derived from our simulations spans from ∼150 to ∼240 Gpc-3 yr-1 and is only mildly dependent on CE efficiency. In contrast, the current merger rates of DNSs (ranging from ∼20 to ∼600 Gpc-3 yr-1) and NSBHs (ranging from ∼10 to ∼100 Gpc-3 yr-1) strongly depend on the assumptions on CE and natal kicks. The merger rate of DNSs is consistent with the one inferred from the detection of GW170817 only if a high efficiency of CE ejection and low-SN kicks (drawn from a Maxwellian distribution with one-dimensional root mean square σ = 15 km s-1) are assumed.},

	abstract = {The first four gravitational wave events detected by LIGO were all interpreted as merging black hole binaries (BHBs), opening a new perspective on the study of such systems. Here we use our new population-synthesis code MOBSE, an upgraded version of BSE, to investigate the demography of merging BHBs. MOBSE includes metallicity-dependent prescriptions for mass-loss of massive hot stars. It also accounts for the impact of the electron-scattering Eddington factor on mass-loss. We perform {\textgreater}108 simulations of isolated massive binaries, with 12 different metallicities, to study the impact of mass-loss, core-collapse supernovae and common envelope on merging BHBs. Accounting for the dependence of stellar winds on the Eddington factor leads to the formation of black holes (BHs) with mass up to 65 M⊙ at metallicity Z ∼ 0.0002. However, most BHs in merging BHBs have masses ≲ 40 M⊙. We find merging BHBs with mass ratios in the 0.1-1.0 range, even if mass ratios {\textgreater}0.6 are more likely. We predict that systems like GW150914, GW170814 and GW170104 can form only from progenitors with metallicity Z ≤ 0.006, Z ≤ 0.008 and Z ≤ 0.012, respectively. Most merging BHBs have gone through a common envelope phase, but up to ∼17 per cent merging BHBs at low metallicity did not undergo any common envelope phase. We find a much higher number of mergers from metal-poor progenitors than from metal-rich ones: the number of BHB mergers per unit mass is ∼10-4 M\_\{⊙\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} at low metallicity (Z = 0.0002-0.002) and drops to ∼10-7 M\_\{⊙\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} at high metallicity (Z ∼ 0.02).},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, supernovae have emerged as some of the most powerful tools for measuring extragalactic distances. A well developed physical understanding of type II supernovae allow them to be used to measure distances independent of the extragalactic distance scale. Type Ia supernovae are empirical tools whose precision and intrinsic brightness make them sensitive probes of the cosmological expansion. Both types of supernovae are consistent with a Hubble Constant within char 12610\% of H0 = 70 km s-1Mpc-1. Two teams have used type Ia supernovae to trace the expansion of the Universe to a look-back time more than 60\% of the age of the Universe. These observations show an accelerating Universe which is currently best explained by a cosmological constant or other form of dark energy with an equation of state near w = p/rho = -1. While there are many possible remaining systematic effects, none appears large enough to challenge these current results. Future experiments are planned to better character ize the equation of state of the dark energy leading to the observed acceleration by observing hundreds or even thousands of objects. These experiments will need to carefully control systematic errors to ensure future conclusions are not dominated by effects unrelated to cosmology.},
