An open source scientific article created using the [showyourwork](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork) workflow about doing GW spectral siren cosmology with a non-parametric model for the mass distribution of GW sources. 

All source code for this project is containted within `src/scripts/`. Some are not used within the showyourwork workflow as they are expensive (bias_study.py and nonparametric_inference_fitOm0.py). The outputs of these have instead been published to zenodo and showyourwork is set up to automatically download them when building the article.
